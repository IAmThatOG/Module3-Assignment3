            My name is Okolie Gabriel Ifeanyi. I hail from Delta state, Nigeria. I was born on the 21st of March into a christian home.
            I am dark in complexion, 5.9ft tall i don't know if i'm taller than that now, I am handsome and smart.
            I am the eldest of three siblings. My best food is well garnished fried rice, vegetable salad and grilled chicken.
            I also love eating pizza a lot. I aspire to be a top coder and software developer. My favourite football team is Barcelona
            <b>Up Barca!!!...</b><br>
            Well, that's all I can tell you for now. Navigate to <b>contacts</b> if you wanna hook-up (<em>for the ladies</em>) or if you
            need a good pal (<em>for the guys</em>)
